  <div class"question">
    <h4>Is Circuit right for me?</h4>
    <p>Do you love working out? Do you hate being lazy? Do you love being lazy, but know you shouldn’t be? Circuit is what you’ve been looking for. Quick, intense workouts that will kick your butt into shape. Because we all need a little butt kicking every now and again.</p>
  </div>

  <div class"question">
    <h4>Do I need special equipment?</h4>
    <p>No. Ain’t nobody got money for that. You know how getting out of bed can be hard sometimes? That’s because our bodies ARE a weight, and sleep is good. It’s called bodyweight (clever), and that’s all you need to get started with Circuit. Adding extra weight is as simple as picking up a sack of rocks or a small child, whatever is at your disposal.</p>
  </div>

  <div class"question">
    <h4>Are Circuit workouts fun?</h4>
    <p>Unless you are somebody that enjoys torture working out, not really. The great thing about Circuit is that you are in control. Make your workout as easy or as hard as you want. Too easy? Shorten your rest periods, add weight, or increase reps on your next Circuit. Too hard? You might throw up, just being honest.</p>
  </div>

  <div class"question">
    <h4>Should I sign up?</h4>
    <p>Yes. Real talk, working out is a struggle for most people, but everyone needs to do it. The hardest parts are finding time and knowing what to do. Circuit helps with both of those things. All it takes is 20-30 minutes a few times a week to stay healthy and fit, really.</p>
